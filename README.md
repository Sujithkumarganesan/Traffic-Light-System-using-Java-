# Traffic-Light-System-using-Java-
This Java Swing project simulates a traffic light controller with a graphical interface. It cycles through red, yellow, and green lights based on user-defined durations. The GUI updates in real time, and the simulation runs on a separate thread, ensuring responsive and interactive behavior.
