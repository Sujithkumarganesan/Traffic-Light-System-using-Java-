# Traffic-Light-System-using-Java-
This Java Swing project simulates a traffic light controller with a graphical interface. It cycles through red, yellow, and green lights based on user-defined durations. The GUI updates in real time, and the simulation runs on a separate thread, ensuring responsive and interactive behavior.
Steps to Run the Project:
 1) Download the file smart_traffic.
 2) set up the vscode.
 3) Install the OpenJDK and connect with the vscode.
 4) In the terminal type java -version to check if the java is installed or not.
 5) If the java installed properly and then check javac -version.
 6) Now let's compile and run your traffic light controller program:
  javac TrafficLightControllerSwing.java
 7) If the compilation was successful and then run the code by using the command line:
  java TrafficLightControllerSwing
 8) Now enter the time duration of the light like Green, Red, Yellow.
 9) And the final output will shown in the JDK by glowing Light.
